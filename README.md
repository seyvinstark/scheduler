# scheduler
This project was a need for me
I always had trouble scheduling the tasks i had to do and sticking to it.
This pushed me to build a simple program that could sort the tasks i had to do by their urgency and difficulty
and give me a plan of attack of which tasks i chould do first

I built it in C with lists, structures and functions(basic concepts).
i documented it and the files should have the reasoning behind the program
